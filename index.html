<img class = "img" src = "Languages.jpg"><p>I have always been interested in languages. <br> I can fluently speak, read and write in <br> French, English, Spanish and Japanese. <br/> My passion for this comes from the fact that I have Asperger's Syndrome (a form of high functioning Autism) which makes me constantly challenge myself in an effort to be able to better communicate with others.</p></div>
<div id = "paragraph">
<img class = "img" src = "Zorianff9.png"><p>Another passion of mine is Japanese Manga and Anime, which led me to study and learn Japanese. <br> About 18 months ago, I started to edit and contribute data on the wiki page of <a href='http://kyokainorinne.wikia.com/wiki/User:Zorianff9' style="color:red">KyÎ´kai no Rinne</a> <br> in order to improve its content and make the information given more precise and complete, and as an homage to Rumiko Takahashi, the author, whom I greatly admire for her prolific 40 years of continuous creation.  <br>It was through this experience that I became interested in coding- a new language for me to learn and master.</p></div>
<div id = "paragraph">
<img class = "img" src = "Hands.jpg"><p>Founders & Coders could be a great opportunity for me due to my neurodiversity. <br> I am on the mild side of the autism spectrum, which means I function normally; but have the capacity to pursue activities with a passion for long periods of time and become very good at them. <br> I'm also very patient, calm and a good teacher. <br> I would like to be able to earn my living, by coding, creating and improving pages.</p></div>
<div id = "paragraph">
<img class = "img" src = "Earth.png"><p>Also, I have a long-time project of my own, on which I have been working for a couple of years; and being able to share its content and post it online <br> seems like the perfect solution for this. <br> The objective would be to share some of the lessons about life which I have learned throughout my journey.</p>
